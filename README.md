# Enhancing Security with Real-Time Animal Intruder Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model that detects animal intruders in restricted areas. The system triggers alarms and sends email alerts with captured images and animal identification, enhancing security through real-time monitoring for agricultural and private properties.

## Features
- **Real-Time Animal Detection:** Uses deep learning for object detection.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends email notifications with captured images and details.
- **Security Enhancement:** Helps protect agricultural fields and private properties.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded to detect more animal species.
